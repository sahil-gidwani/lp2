# Time Complexity: The time complexity of the solver algorithm is O(N!), 
# where N is the number of rows and columns in the square board. 
# This is because for each column, the algorithm tries to place a queen in each row and 
# then recursively tries to place the queens in the remaining columns. 
# The number of possible combinations of queen placements in the board is N! since there can 
# be only one queen in each row and each column.

# Space Complexity: The space complexity of the solver algorithm is O(N^2), 
# where N is the number of rows and columns in the square board. T
# his is because we are using a 2D vector to represent the board, which takes up N^2 space. 
# Additionally, we are using three boolean arrays to keep track of the occupied rows and diagonals, 
# which take up 2N-1 space each. Therefore, the total space complexity is O(N^2 + 6N â€“ 3), 
# which is equivalent to O(N^2).
